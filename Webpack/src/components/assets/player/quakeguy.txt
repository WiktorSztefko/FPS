This is the Quake player model by Rikki Knight. The player and weapon skin are id softwares.

These files must be in quake2\baseq2\players\quakeguy or they won't work.

Start up a game of Quake 2, and go to the Multiplayer menu.  Choose the Quakeguy model.

Thanks: to Kray-zee for some advice on modeling.

P.S.: If you guys start transfering skins from Quakeworld for this model, e-mail them to me 
     so I can put a skin pack up on my skins site. Thanks...
